**DevOps Project for Farm-Product-E-Commerce**
The "Farm Products E-Commerce" project is a comprehensive web-based application designed to facilitate the buying and selling of farm products. The platform offers distinct interfaces for sellers, customers, and administrators, streamlining interactions and transactions within the agricultural market.

**Tools and Technologies Used in the DevOps Project:**
1) **Version Control**: Git and GitHub were used for version control, enabling collaboration and continuous integration.

3) **Configuration Management**: Ansible was utilized to automate and manage configurations across multiple environments.

4)**Containerization**: Docker was employed to containerize the application, ensuring consistency and portability across different environments.

5) **Orchestration**: Kubernetes was used for container orchestration, managing the deployment, scaling, and operation of application containers.

6) **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform was used to define and provision the infrastructure required for the project.

7) **Monitoring and Logging**: Prometheus and Grafana were integrated to monitor the application's performance and visualize metrics. ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) was set up for logging and analyzing log data.

8) **Testing**: Pytest was used for writing and running automated tests to ensure the application's reliability and functionality.

9) **Static Code Analysis**: SonarQube was incorporated to analyze the code quality and identify potential issues.
